How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?  Diff compared the files to eachother and showed the differences in information.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? I will be able to compare before and after to see the differences and chages that have occured. Note those of value and move one.

Because you work on a system as a whole so multi-file commits are important vs. Google Docs which treats each file individuall.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? _ I can always roll back the commit and use the 'change' that has the correct or best coding choices. It allows me to explore different changes and tests so I can be confident that I will not break anything.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I can stay organized with current files which will only live on production and keep old files which would now be old commits. This leaves the site directory less cluttered.
