Q:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:  I would want to use a remote repository over local becuase of colaberation efforts with other devs and a personal backup. A remote repository is another area to store code incase somthing happens locally.

Q:  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:  Pulling changes manually allows you to review the commits that have occured. Plus if you are in a collabrative enviroment going automatic could merge code you removed.

Q:  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A:  Forks: Forks are clones files that live within Github
  Clones: Clones are pull requests from a Github repository that live locally
  Branches: Branches are a new division of your master code set. Branches are used to test concepts and ideas not on the master code base.

Q:  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A:  This allows you to build off of a current branch/master so your code is in sync with the remote respostitory. You can also track changes of your local vs. your remote.
