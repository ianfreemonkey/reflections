When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?--
I would want to use a remote repository over local becuase of colaberation efforts with other devs and a personal backup.
A remote repository is another area to store code incase somthing happens locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?--
Pulling changes manually allows you to review the commits that have occured. Plus if you are in a collabrative enviroment going automatic could merge code you removed.
